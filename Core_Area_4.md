## 4 – Communication and working with others

### 4 Description

I regularly collaborate across technical, academic, and administrative teams to deliver digital capability initiatives. For the LinkedIn Learning SCIM rollout, I worked with IT Microsoft 365 administration and Moodle administrators to ensure both robust implementation and clear communication to staff and students.

I also disseminate practice externally through sector events such as the SHIFT Conference, where I have presented on AI for digital inclusion. SHIFT is a conference for Higher Education professionals and attracts an international audience. Internally, I lead workshops and share updates through institutional communication channels.

### 4 Reflection

The most effective collaborations have been those where communication was two-way from the outset. In projects where I initially relied on broadcast updates, adoption was slower. Over time, I’ve built more structured feedback loops into every project, using both formal evaluation and informal conversations to adapt delivery in real time.

Feedback and collaboration are vital to the improvement of my work. In digital technology, things inevitably go wrong, and digital skills often require the ability to stay calm and adapt when challenges arise.

One example occurred during a workshop on early-stage spreadsheet skills. I had planned to use an interactive worksheet supplied by Microsoft within Excel, but discovered at the start of the session that the worksheet was no longer available. I had no backup copy and had not checked its availability beforehand—two mistakes I learned from.

Rather than cancel the session, I turned the problem into a collaborative opportunity. My teaching plan already included encouraging students to use Microsoft 365 Copilot (available to all students and staff at the university) to develop and understand spreadsheets. I brought this section forward and invited students to create their own worksheets tailored to their challenges, using Copilot as a coach. We then shared the results and discussed how tools like Copilot could support digital skill development.

This experience reinforced the CMALT value of empathy and the importance of learning from colleagues and students. It also demonstrated the value of disseminating effective practice through shared problem-solving and peer learning.

Additionally, I work closely with colleagues from different departments, and in understanding their challenges I have improved my own skills. For example, working with the licensing department has highlighted the importance of knowing the details of tool features. While I may focus on certain key elements, it is essential to understand what different licences enable or restrict to support informed decision-making.
