## 4a – Communication and working with others

### 4a Description

I regularly collaborate across technical, academic, and administrative teams to deliver digital capability initiatives. For the LinkedIn Learning SCIM rollout, I worked with IT security, Moodle administrators, and the branding team to ensure both robust implementation and clear communication to staff and students.

I also disseminate practice externally through sector events such as the SHIFT Conference, where I have presented on AI for digital inclusion. Internally, I run drop-in clinics, lead workshops, and share updates through institutional communication channels.

### 4a Reflection

The most effective collaborations have been those where communication was two-way from the outset. In projects where I initially relied on broadcast updates, adoption was slower. Over time, I’ve built more structured feedback loops into every project, using both formal evaluation and informal conversations to adapt delivery in real time.
