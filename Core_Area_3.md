## 3a – Understanding and engaging with legislation

### 3a Description

I have received Continuing Professional Development training on the UK General Data Protection Regulation (retained EU Regulation 2016/679), as supplemented by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Equality Act 2010. These frameworks underpin my approach to privacy, inclusion, and ethical practice in learning technology.
In my previous role as a technology business owner, I developed a thorough practical understanding of UK GDPR and DPA 2018, which was essential for delivering projects involving some of society’s most vulnerable members.
Both these acts and the ongoing training influence how I select, configure, and deploy learning technologies. For example, the Digital Backpack SCORM tool was designed so that individual results remain visible only to the student — meeting privacy requirements and supporting learner autonomy.

Similarly, SCIM provisioning for LinkedIn Learning ensures account access is role-based and automatically removed when users leave the institution, reducing the risk of data breaches.

Accessibility legislation also underpins my workshop design, ensuring that resources meet WCAG guidelines and are compatible with assistive technologies.

### 3a Reflection

Legislation is essential—not only as a legal requirement but as a foundation for ethical practice. I believe that adherence should stem from a desire to do good and to be a considerate, empathetic colleague. Compliance driven by fear may lead to minimalism, whereas ethics-driven practice fosters best practice. My work is guided by a commitment to full inclusion and respect for privacy, and I actively apply legal principles to ensure that digital tools and services meet accessibility and data protection standards.

Applying legislation in practice has shown me that compliance is not enough; ethical considerations often go further. For instance, AI tools like Copilot meet legal requirements but may still censor content in ways that disadvantage certain subjects or research areas. This realisation has reinforced the importance of combining legal compliance with proactive advocacy for equitable access.

GDPR was one of several factors that shaped our design decisions. For example, with LinkedIn Learning integration we opted against a full analytics feed. This was partly because of resource constraints, but also because I felt we could not yet do it in a way that was fully robust against GDPR requirements. This choice reinforced my view that legislation and technical capability must both be balanced when designing learning technology systems.

## 3b – Understanding and engaging with policies and standards

### 3b Description

Engaging with policy development has helped contextualise and temper my technologically focused work. I am unapologetically interested in digital technology and its transformative potential, which has led to opportunities to contribute to innovative approaches during early-stage technology adoption. However, I recognise that for technology to deliver long-term value in education, it must transition from experimentation to acceptance. Policy development provides the structure and accountability needed to support this transition.

Early in my work at Greenwich, I reviewed existing guidance on the use of Artificial Intelligence. I noticed that the policy was written too broadly and encompassed all aspects of AI, rather than focusing on generative AI. I researched a suitable justification for a rewrite and contributed to the development of an updated policy that better reflects current practice and ethical considerations.

I also actively contribute to the University of Greenwich’s AI Special Interest Group (AI-SIG), influencing internal policy on ethical AI use in teaching and learning. My work also aligns with national frameworks such as the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework (Jisc, 2018) and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework (Department for Education, 2019), both embedded into the design of the Digital Backpack.

I have advised on the adoption of Microsoft Copilot, flagging privacy, bias, and censorship issues, and contributed to draft guidance that frames AI as a support tool rather than a decision-maker.

### 3b Reflection

Engaging with policy at both institutional and sector levels has taught me the value of timing and framing — policy recommendations gain more traction when supported by concrete evidence and aligned with current strategic priorities. The challenge remains to bridge the gap between fast-moving technology developments and slower-moving policy cycles.

The innovator in me is often frustrated by bureaucratic delays, but I have come to value the role of policy in promoting ethical and sustainable practice. Policy development has helped me understand the importance of balancing innovation with responsibility, ensuring that new technologies are adopted in ways that are inclusive, transparent, and aligned with institutional values.
