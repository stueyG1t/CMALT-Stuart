## 3a – Understanding and engaging with legislation

### 3a Description

My work is shaped by UK GDPR and the Equality Act 2010, both of which influence how I select, configure, and deploy learning technologies. For example, the Digital Backpack SCORM tool was designed so that individual results remain visible only to the student — meeting privacy requirements and supporting learner autonomy.

Similarly, SCIM provisioning for LinkedIn Learning ensures account access is role-based and automatically removed when users leave the institution, reducing the risk of data breaches. Accessibility legislation also underpins my workshop design, ensuring that resources meet WCAG guidelines and are compatible with assistive technologies.

### 3a Reflection

Applying legislation in practice has shown me that compliance is not enough; ethical considerations often go further. For instance, AI tools like Copilot meet legal requirements but may still censor content in ways that disadvantage certain subjects or research areas. This realisation has reinforced the importance of combining legal compliance with proactive advocacy for equitable access.

## 3b – Understanding and engaging with policies and standards

### 3b Description

I actively contribute to the University of Greenwich’s AI Special Interest Group (AI-SIG), influencing internal policy on ethical AI use in teaching and learning. My work also aligns with national frameworks such as the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework, both embedded into the design of the Digital Backpack.

I have advised on the adoption of Microsoft Copilot, flagging privacy, bias, and censorship issues, and contributed to draft guidance that frames AI as a support tool rather than a decision-maker.

### 3b Reflection

Engaging with policy at both institutional and sector levels has taught me the value of timing and framing — policy recommendations gain more traction when supported by concrete evidence and aligned with current strategic priorities. The challenge remains to bridge the gap between fast-moving technology developments and slower-moving policy cycles.
