## 1a – Understanding the constraints and benefits of different technologies

### 1a Description

At the University of Greenwich, I have led the deployment of learning technologies that balance pedagogic value, inclusivity, and technical sustainability. A notable example is the integration of LinkedIn Learning with Moodle via LTI 1.3, underpinned by SCIM provisioning for automated account management and role-based access. This solution was selected for its interoperability, reduced administrative overhead, and improved security compliance. This was in response to increasing tutor enquries about to get more from LinkedIn Learning.

> "It would be great to make a brief [LinkedIn Learning] pathway... So both students and staff could have quick way of learning more about it..." – *Tutor query about LinkedIn Learning*
> "Getting a lot of interest from tutors in the ability to start importing LinkedIn Learning modules." – *Email extract from Stuart Smith to Moodle team, 25 November 2024*

Similarly, the Digital Backpack diagnostic was designed to run within Moodle as a SCORM package, aligning with existing institutional infrastructure to maximise accessibility, while avoiding reliance on proprietary external hosting that could introduce GDPR or data retention risks. These decisions were informed by both technical affordances and institutional policy requirements, as well as the need to support a diverse, widening participation student body.

### 1a Reflection

Working with systems of this scale has reinforced that the “best” tool is not always the one with the most features, but the one most fit for the local technical and policy environment. In both the LinkedIn Learning integration and Digital Backpack implementation, the biggest wins came from aligning with institutional authentication systems and workflow — reducing friction for students and tutors.

One lesson learned is the importance of piloting technologies under realistic constraints rather than in idealised conditions. For example, initial Backpack testing underestimated the impact of mobile access patterns, prompting interface adjustments to improve the experience on smaller screens.

## 1b – Technical knowledge and ability in the use of learning technology

### 1b Description

My role demands hands-on technical proficiency across multiple platforms, particularly Microsoft 365, Moodle, and LinkedIn Learning. I have authored and distributed detailed tutor-facing resources, such as the “Embedding LinkedIn Learning in Moodle” step-by-step guide, enabling colleagues to confidently embed learning resources within their modules without additional technical support.

I am proficient in configuring SCORM-based learning objects, as evidenced by the Digital Backpack diagnostic tool, and in optimising accessibility settings within Moodle, Microsoft Teams, and LinkedIn Learning.

My technical knowledge extends to evaluating the viability of AI-enabled tools (e.g., Microsoft Copilot), assessing their accessibility features, ethical implications, and impact on user experience.

### 1b Reflection

Producing technical documentation has taught me the importance of balancing accuracy with accessibility of language. Overly technical instructions risk alienating tutors with limited digital confidence, while oversimplified guidance can lead to errors. The solution has been iterative: releasing early drafts, observing usage patterns, and refining based on feedback.

My Copilot evaluations have shown me how commercial AI integrations can be hindered by opaque censorship rules, prompting advocacy for greater institutional transparency on tool limitations. This has influenced my ongoing work in the AI-SIG and in supporting evidence-led decisions on AI adoption.

## 1c – Supporting the deployment of learning technologies

### 1c Description

I have led multiple deployments of learning technologies at Greenwich, notably the rollout of SCIM-linked LinkedIn Learning access and the Digital Backpack launch. My responsibilities included coordinating with technical teams to ensure secure data flows, working with the branding team to ensure student-facing materials were accessible and aligned with institutional style, and delivering tutor briefings on integration benefits and usage.

In both cases, I developed support resources (PDF guides, workshop slides) and delivered drop-in sessions for staff. For the Backpack, I also worked directly with students to test workflows, ensuring the output reports were clear and actionable for learners at all confidence levels.

### 1c Reflection

Effective deployment is as much about people as it is about systems. Early in my career, I underestimated the importance of change management — assuming that a technically sound rollout would naturally result in adoption. Experience has shown me the need for staged communication, targeted training, and active feedback loops to support both cultural and technical adoption.
