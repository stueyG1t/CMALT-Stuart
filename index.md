## Contextual Statement
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>
I am currently a digital skills developer at the University of Greenwich, where I lead institutional efforts to improve digital capability among students and staff. My work is grounded in the belief that learning technology is not just a set of tools, but a form of literacy essential to equity, empowerment, and future-readiness in higher education.

I have not previously completed Certified Membership of the Association for Learning Technology (CMALT), but I strongly identify with its values – particularly the commitment to exploring the interplay between technology and learning, and to supporting ethical, accessible, and inclusive practice. My Senior CMALT submission builds directly on the critical reflection and pedagogical development undertaken as part of my PGCert in Teaching in Higher Education, where I shifted from competence-based delivery to confidence-based facilitation, and began to see myself more as an educator than a technologist.

One of the cornerstones of my practice is the Digital Backpack, a university-wide initiative that I have led from inception. Designed to address widening participation, digital inclusion, and curriculum-embedded skills development, the Backpack includes a formative, confidence-based diagnostic tool aligned with both the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework (Jisc, 2022) and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework (Department for Education, 2019). I have led cross-departmental collaboration – including with the Moodle and branding teams – negotiated access to institutional systems, and worked directly with students to co-design inclusive interventions.

In parallel, I have overseen the integration of LinkedIn Learning using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol, improving provisioning, segmentation, and analytics to support data-informed strategy. This work has enabled more focused engagement initiatives and greater value realisation from the institution’s investment.

I also mentor both students and staff – for example, supporting a Business School undergraduate exploring careers in learning platforms, and advising staff colleagues on digital capability development and resource design. These mentoring experiences have strengthened my commitment to developing others and fostering leadership outside formal hierarchies.

My impact spans local, institutional, and sector levels. Locally, I deliver inclusive workshops and consultations that build agency and digital confidence. Institutionally, I contribute to strategic conversations aligned with our 2030 “digital-first” vision (University of Greenwich, 2022). Sector-wide, I have spoken at events like the SHIFT Conference 2024, contribute to an internal Artificial Intelligence (AI) Special Interest Group (AI-SIG), and have helped shape guidance on the ethical use of generative AI in teaching and learning.

I also support evidence-based decision making by evaluating tools such as the Jisc Digital Capabilities Tool, LinkedIn Learning, and Microsoft Teams Premium – particularly for their AI affordances and accessibility features. These evaluations have influenced purchasing, policy, and practice at Greenwich.

This portfolio represents the next step in my professional development – from practitioner to institutional influencer. Through sustained work in learning technology, I have developed a strong strategic voice, a focus on inclusion and confidence-building, and a desire to contribute not only to my institution, but to national conversations about the ethical, inclusive, and purposeful use of digital tools in higher education.

## Core Area 1a: Understanding the Constraints and Benefits of Different Technologies

### Description

As the institutional lead for LinkedIn Learning at the University of Greenwich, one of my primary responsibilities has been to ensure we derive maximum value from our investment in the platform. LinkedIn Learning offers wide-ranging skills development opportunities for both students and staff, particularly in areas such as digital literacy, employability, and personal development. However, it is a third-party platform and not directly integrated with the university’s core systems.

A key challenge we encountered was the fragmentation between LinkedIn Learning and Moodle, our primary Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Tutors were required to manage content and learners across two systems. This led to duplicated effort, difficulties tracking student progress, and inconsistent user experiences.

To address these issues, I led the integration of LinkedIn Learning into Moodle using Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) 1.3, enabling tutors to embed learning resources directly into their course areas. This provided a more seamless experience for students, where progress could be monitored centrally within Moodle.

This solution was evaluated against several key criteria:

* Interoperability – using an established standard that enables secure, role-aware data exchange
* Sustainability – reducing duplicate account management and making the solution scalable
* Tutor workload – simplifying access to curated content and freeing time for teaching and support
* User engagement – embedding content directly into courses encourages more consistent uptake

In parallel, I supported the adoption of the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol to automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts. SCIM allows synchronisation of role-based access using data from HR and student records systems. While Single Sign-On (SSO) supports authentication, SCIM adds granular access control and supports segmentation by audience, enabling tailored communications and learning pathways.

These choices were not without constraints. Moodle's limited support for deep linking in LTI 1.3 required significant workaround planning and the creation of support guides for tutors. The SCIM rollout required coordination across IT, HR, and third-party vendors, as well as careful alignment with internal data governance processes.

The integration has so far been piloted with a small group of tutors. While formal evaluation is still underway, initial anecdotal feedback has been positive. Tutors noted the simplicity of embedding resources and the benefit of being able to track student engagement within Moodle. Interest from professional services colleagues has also grown, particularly from HR, who are exploring LinkedIn Learning as a CPD platform for staff.

### Reflection
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>
This project sharpened my understanding of what “fit for purpose” really means in educational technology. The most effective tools are not those with the most features, but those that integrate well into existing systems and workflows. Integration alone can fundamentally alter how a tool is perceived – transforming LinkedIn Learning from an optional resource to a valued part of the course delivery toolkit.

Initially, I underestimated how much of a barrier even small user experience issues could be. Once integration removed the friction of switching platforms, tutors became more open to engaging with LinkedIn Learning as a core teaching tool. It was a lesson in how technology decisions are only as effective as their adoption – and adoption depends on context and clarity.

This project also strengthened my skills in cross-functional collaboration. Implementing SCIM required not only technical understanding, but also communication between teams with very different priorities and vocabularies. I learned to frame technical decisions in terms of pedagogical and operational benefit, making the case for scalable, long-term solutions that are sustainable and inclusive.

Looking ahead, I am interested in exploring more advanced features of LTI and SCIM integration, including trigger-based recommendations and pathways based on learner progression. This work represents my commitment to digital systems that enable autonomy, reduce barriers, and align with wider institutional strategies for inclusive and accessible education.

## Core Area 1b: Technical Knowledge and Ability in the Use of Learning Technology
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>

### Description

As a digital skills developer at the University of Greenwich, I apply a wide-ranging technical skill set across institutional platforms, open web technologies, and emerging AI tools. My core responsibilities include developing and embedding learning technologies that are scalable, inclusive, and strategically aligned with the university’s ambition to become a digital-first institution by 2030.

I support the creation, delivery, and integration of learning content using:

* Moodle (including Sharable Content Object Reference Model. (SCORM) packaging and plugin integration)
* Microsoft 365 (Teams, OneNote, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, Outlook, and Copilot)
* LinkedIn Learning, including LTI 1.3 integration for Moodle
* Custom tools for diagnostic and formative assessment – most notably the Digital Backpack

I hold a Master’s degree in Computing Science, where my dissertation focused on accessibility and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). Earlier in my career, I contributed to Jisc-published research on accessibility in education – work that continues to influence my values-led approach to inclusive technology adoption.

As part of my ongoing professional development, I completed the ACAD-1441-M02-2024-25 Digital Teaching and Technology Enhanced Learning in Higher Education module at the University of Greenwich ([Moodle course link](https://moodlecurrent.gre.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=107625)). This course forms part of my PGCert and deepened my understanding of how learning technologies interact with pedagogical design. It also helped me stay current with sector practices, particularly in relation to accessibility, feedback, and student engagement.

### Reflection

My technical practice is rooted in the principle that accessibility is not a feature – it is a foundation. This philosophy informs both the tools I build and the formats I advocate. Structured textual formats like Markdown, semantically formatted Word documents, and HTML are not only accessible across devices and assistive technologies – they are also highly compatible with AI-powered tools like Copilot. Where learning content is structured well, tools such as Copilot are more likely to enhance clarity and engagement; where it is poorly structured, AI often compounds confusion.

In a sector increasingly dependent on multimedia and automation, I continue to champion open, portable, and inclusive design. However, I have also learned to balance idealism with pragmatism. SCORM, for example, is not the most modern standard, but its compatibility with Moodle allows me to deploy tools quickly and at scale while the institution upgrades its infrastructure.

A key example of impact is the development of the Digital Backpack capabilities assessment tool. Originally conceived as a judgement-based quiz, the tool was redesigned as a confidence-based diagnostic in direct response to feedback from colleagues across the Academic Learning Enhancement team, accessibility specialists, and digital skills practitioners. Their insight highlighted the potential for judgemental assessment models to alienate students – particularly those who lacked confidence or came from non-traditional learning backgrounds. I led the technical and pedagogical redesign to ensure the new tool was aligned with the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework. The resulting confidence-based diagnostic now forms the basis of the university’s approach to digital skills assessment for incoming students.

This development is significant because there was previously no mechanism for diagnosing digital capability gaps at the point of entry. Given that all students are expected to engage with core digital tools from day one, the absence of diagnostic data created a serious equity issue. Without it, there was no effective way to allocate support, design inclusive interventions, or prioritise resources. By implementing the Digital Backpack as a formative, scalable tool, I have helped position it as a key institutional asset – providing a foundation for targeted upskilling, improved onboarding, and longer-term student success.

This work embodies several of the core CMALT principles: understanding the interplay between technology and learning, advocating for sustainable and inclusive practice, staying current with evolving tools, and working across professional boundaries to communicate and embed effective solutions.

## Core Area 1c: Supporting the Deployment of Learning Technologies

<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>

### Description

At the University of Greenwich, I play a central role in supporting the deployment of learning technologies for both students and staff. This includes not only implementing tools such as SCORM packages, LinkedIn Learning, and Microsoft Copilot, but also designing and refining systems that address institutional gaps – most notably the Digital Backpack.

The Digital Backpack was developed in response to a significant shortfall in how digital skills were assessed and supported for students entering the university. While Greenwich had previously subscribed to the Jisc Digital Capabilities Tool, its use was not embedded in a strategic or inclusive way. It also carried assumptions about user competence that made it difficult for students with limited digital experience to engage effectively.

In contrast, my approach has been to develop a tool that assumes minimal digital fluency on entry. I aligned the Digital Backpack’s capabilities assessment with both the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework. Rather than relying on off-the-shelf solutions – which were prohibitively expensive and misaligned with our needs – I created a bespoke, confidence-based diagnostic through low-cost prototyping. This allowed me to demonstrate proof of concept and secure institutional buy-in for a tool that better meets the needs of our student population.

A significant barrier to deployment was the university’s digital strategy, which prioritises the use of existing systems. While this policy makes sense in many contexts, it did not accommodate the need for a tailored diagnostic tool that could bridge systemic gaps in digital support. By working within this constraint and proving both demand and feasibility, I was able to progress from prototype to live pilot while remaining consistent with institutional values.

### Collaboration and Impact

One of the most impactful elements of this work has been its collaborative development. I worked closely with colleagues across the Academic Learning Enhancement (ALE) team – who support academic staff development – to align our efforts. Through regular meetings and informal knowledge exchange, we identified shared goals and were able to accelerate the development of both our tools.

This collaboration led to a shared GitHub architecture, where different versions of the Digital Backpack assessment tool could be branched and adapted to suit distinct audiences. One branch now serves the ALE team’s tutor-facing needs, another supports the digital skills offer for students, and a third is under consideration for the Professional Services team to support staff induction. This branching approach supports sustainability and makes the tool flexible enough to grow with evolving institutional needs.

Beyond technical implementation, this work has started to shift how digital skills are framed at the university. By embedding the Digital Backpack in the upcoming curriculum framework, it will become a structured expectation rather than an optional add-on. Students will complete the diagnostic on arrival, enabling targeted support, early interventions, and a clearer sense of digital expectations. This cultural change – from vague digital literacy notions to clearly scaffolded digital citizenship – is one of the most significant outcomes of this deployment.

### Reflection

This experience has reaffirmed the value of open collaboration, low-cost prototyping, and values-driven development. While policy constraints initially limited solution options, I learned to work creatively within them, using institutional dialogue and pilot data to advocate for a more suitable tool.

I also gained a deeper appreciation for the diversity of learners and staff. Our student body includes individuals with little exposure to digital tools beyond passive smartphone use. Likewise, new staff arrive with highly variable digital confidence. Recognising this helped me frame digital skills not as assumed background knowledge, but as a necessary entitlement. That framing informed both the design of the tool and how I supported its rollout.

This deployment work aligns with the CMALT principles of collaboration, critical reflection, and sustainable practice. By embedding a flexible, inclusive assessment tool across departments and user groups, I have contributed to a more coherent and equitable digital experience at Greenwich – one that begins at induction and continues throughout a student’s academic journey.
