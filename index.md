## Confirmation Statement
I declare that, to the best of my knowledge, the statements and evidence included in this submission accurately describe my practice and are drawn from my own work, with the input and support of others duly and clearly recognised.

**Signed:** Stuart Smith

**Date:** 19 August 2025

## Description

{% include fig.html id='stuart-smith-portrait' align='left' %}

I am the Digital Skills Developer at the University of Greenwich, leading institutional initiatives to improve digital capability among students and staff. I view learning technology not simply as a collection of tools, but as a literacy essential for student empowerment, equity, and future-readiness.

I design and lead innovative, high-impact digital initiatives that deliver sustained benefits, shaping practice both institutionally and within the wider sector. A prominent example is the Digital Backpack, a formative, confidence-based digital skills diagnostic and development framework aligned to the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework (2022) and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework (2019). Developed from inception and continually evolved under my leadership, it addresses widening participation, digital inclusion, and curriculum-embedded skills development. Delivery has involved cross-departmental collaboration (Moodle and Academic Learning Enhancement teams), system access negotiations, and direct student co-design work.

I have also led the LinkedIn Learning integration using SCIM provisioning, enabling improved analytics, segmentation, and data-driven engagement strategies.

Beyond systems work, I mentor both students and staff — from supporting a Business School undergraduate exploring careers in learning platforms to advising colleagues on digital capability resource design.

My influence spans multiple levels:

- **Local**: Inclusive workshops and consultations that build digital agency and confidence.
- **Institutional**: Contributions to strategic planning aligned with the 2030 “digital-first” vision.
- **Sector**: Speaking at the SHIFT Conference 2024, contributing to the Artificial Intelligence Special Interest Group, and shaping guidance on the ethical use of generative AI in learning and teaching.

I also evaluate learning technologies such as the Jisc Digital Capabilities Tool, LinkedIn Learning, and Microsoft Teams Premium, particularly for their AI affordances and accessibility, influencing institutional purchasing, policy, and practice.

## Reflection

My work has helped me understand that sustainable digital capability growth depends on confidence, not just competence. This aligns with the CMALT principle of understanding the "interplay between technology and learning" (Association for Learning Technology, 2019). Confidence arises not merely from imitation but from understanding — students must grasp why a particular technology is used and how its adoption reflects not only technical needs but also political and economic decisions.

This insight is supported by Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy, which emphasises the importance of belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific situations (Bandura, 1997). The Digital Backpack’s confidence-based approach reflects this, helping students build agency through formative, personalised feedback.

Leading the Digital Backpack confirmed that students respond positively when technology is framed in accessible, inclusive language, and when their starting points are recognised rather than judged. The SCIM integration project reinforced the importance of invisible infrastructure improvements that may not be visible to users but dramatically enhance strategic value and targeting.

Looking back, I would have involved students even earlier in certain project stages, particularly in the Backpack’s early iterations. Doing so might have accelerated the inclusivity and relevance of its initial design.

It has been vital to my work to connect with colleagues across the sector with different specialisms (Association for Learning Technology, 2019). I have explored digital technologies with colleagues from each of the faculties at Greenwich and liaised closely with teams within my own Directorate. I benefit from working at an institution with a wide variety of socioeconomic and cultural diversity among staff and students.

Mentoring has been particularly rewarding, deepening my belief that leadership in learning technology is not confined to formal hierarchies. I have also learned that influencing institutional and sector practice requires both persistence and adaptability. Sector engagement at events like SHIFT often feeds back into my institutional work, while in turn, Greenwich projects contribute to national conversations. Helping others understand and apply my work is a CMALT value I hold particularly dearly (Association for Learning Technology, 2019).

I greatly enjoy learning about new technology, and in my current role I have adopted a focus on generative artificial intelligence. In line with CMALT values, I am committed to keeping up to date with new technologies (Association for Learning Technology, 2019). My studies of generative AI are not confined to academic application but also explore its transformative impact on the wider economy.
