## Contextual Statement
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>
I am currently a digital skills developer at the University of Greenwich, where I lead institutional efforts to improve digital capability among students and staff. My work is grounded in the belief that learning technology is not just a set of tools, but a form of literacy essential to equity, empowerment, and future-readiness in higher education.

I have not previously completed Certified Membership of the Association for Learning Technology (CMALT), but I strongly identify with its values – particularly the commitment to exploring the interplay between technology and learning, and to supporting ethical, accessible, and inclusive practice. My Senior CMALT submission builds directly on the critical reflection and pedagogical development undertaken as part of my PGCert in Teaching in Higher Education, where I shifted from competence-based delivery to confidence-based facilitation, and began to see myself more as an educator than a technologist.

One of the cornerstones of my practice is the Digital Backpack, a university-wide initiative that I have led from inception. Designed to address widening participation, digital inclusion, and curriculum-embedded skills development, the Backpack includes a formative, confidence-based diagnostic tool aligned with both the Jisc Digital Capabilities Framework (Jisc, 2022) and the UK Government’s Essential Digital Skills Framework (Department for Education, 2019). I have led cross-departmental collaboration – including with the Moodle and branding teams – negotiated access to institutional systems, and worked directly with students to co-design inclusive interventions.

In parallel, I have overseen the integration of LinkedIn Learning using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol, improving provisioning, segmentation, and analytics to support data-informed strategy. This work has enabled more focused engagement initiatives and greater value realisation from the institution’s investment.

I also mentor both students and staff – for example, supporting a Business School undergraduate exploring careers in learning platforms, and advising staff colleagues on digital capability development and resource design. These mentoring experiences have strengthened my commitment to developing others and fostering leadership outside formal hierarchies.

My impact spans local, institutional, and sector levels. Locally, I deliver inclusive workshops and consultations that build agency and digital confidence. Institutionally, I contribute to strategic conversations aligned with our 2030 “digital-first” vision (University of Greenwich, 2022). Sector-wide, I have spoken at events like the SHIFT Conference 2024, contribute to an internal Artificial Intelligence (AI) Special Interest Group (AI-SIG), and have helped shape guidance on the ethical use of generative AI in teaching and learning.

I also support evidence-based decision making by evaluating tools such as the Jisc Digital Capabilities Tool, LinkedIn Learning, and Microsoft Teams Premium – particularly for their AI affordances and accessibility features. These evaluations have influenced purchasing, policy, and practice at Greenwich.

This portfolio represents the next step in my professional development – from practitioner to institutional influencer. Through sustained work in learning technology, I have developed a strong strategic voice, a focus on inclusion and confidence-building, and a desire to contribute not only to my institution, but to national conversations about the ethical, inclusive, and purposeful use of digital tools in higher education.

## Core Area 1a: Understanding the Constraints and Benefits of Different Technologies
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>

### Description

As the institutional lead for LinkedIn Learning at the University of Greenwich, one of my primary responsibilities has been to ensure we derive maximum value from our investment in the platform. LinkedIn Learning offers wide-ranging skills development opportunities for both students and staff, particularly in areas such as digital literacy, employability, and personal development. However, it is a third-party platform and not directly integrated with the university’s core systems.

A key challenge we encountered was the fragmentation between LinkedIn Learning and Moodle, our primary Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Tutors were required to manage content and learners across two systems. This led to duplicated effort, difficulties tracking student progress, and inconsistent user experiences.

To address these issues, I led the integration of LinkedIn Learning into Moodle using Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) 1.3, enabling tutors to embed learning resources directly into their course areas. This provided a more seamless experience for students, where progress could be monitored centrally within Moodle.

This solution was evaluated against several key criteria:

* Interoperability – using an established standard that enables secure, role-aware data exchange
* Sustainability – reducing duplicate account management and making the solution scalable
* Tutor workload – simplifying access to curated content and freeing time for teaching and support
* User engagement – embedding content directly into courses encourages more consistent uptake

In parallel, I supported the adoption of the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol to automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts. SCIM allows synchronisation of role-based access using data from HR and student records systems. While Single Sign-On (SSO) supports authentication, SCIM adds granular access control and supports segmentation by audience, enabling tailored communications and learning pathways.

These choices were not without constraints. Moodle's limited support for deep linking in LTI 1.3 required significant workaround planning and the creation of support guides for tutors. The SCIM rollout required coordination across IT, HR, and third-party vendors, as well as careful alignment with internal data governance processes.

The integration has so far been piloted with a small group of tutors. While formal evaluation is still underway, initial anecdotal feedback has been positive. Tutors noted the simplicity of embedding resources and the benefit of being able to track student engagement within Moodle. Interest from professional services colleagues has also grown, particularly from HR, who are exploring LinkedIn Learning as a CPD platform for staff.

### Reflection
<details open>
  <summary>Expand or collapse this section</summary>
This project sharpened my understanding of what “fit for purpose” really means in educational technology. The most effective tools are not those with the most features, but those that integrate well into existing systems and workflows. Integration alone can fundamentally alter how a tool is perceived – transforming LinkedIn Learning from an optional resource to a valued part of the course delivery toolkit.

Initially, I underestimated how much of a barrier even small user experience issues could be. Once integration removed the friction of switching platforms, tutors became more open to engaging with LinkedIn Learning as a core teaching tool. It was a lesson in how technology decisions are only as effective as their adoption – and adoption depends on context and clarity.

This project also strengthened my skills in cross-functional collaboration. Implementing SCIM required not only technical understanding, but also communication between teams with very different priorities and vocabularies. I learned to frame technical decisions in terms of pedagogical and operational benefit, making the case for scalable, long-term solutions that are sustainable and inclusive.

Looking ahead, I am interested in exploring more advanced features of LTI and SCIM integration, including trigger-based recommendations and pathways based on learner progression. This work represents my commitment to digital systems that enable autonomy, reduce barriers, and align with wider institutional strategies for inclusive and accessible education.

<p>A core part of my practice involves teaching students how to use tools like Copilot and other digital technologies to support their learning. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly becoming integrated into everyday academic and professional life. In line with UKPSF K2, it is essential to help students use these tools appropriately, not only as aids to study, but as subjects of critical inquiry.</p>

<p>This is reflected in my own practice. For example, during an Excel tutorial, I discovered that key externally supplied learning materials had been deprecated. Instead of abandoning the activity, I used Copilot in real time to generate a new learning task based on prompts co-created with the students. What could have been a failure became a moment of digital empowerment. Students saw that a lack of knowledge wasn’t a dead end, it was an opportunity for collaboration, experimentation, and co-creation.</p>

<p>Copilot excels as a personal tutor or coach. Its ability to interpret natural language, propose ideas, and reframe problems makes it especially valuable for students with lower confidence or those from non-traditional educational backgrounds. This supports UKPSF V2 by promoting equity of access to learning opportunities. However, Copilot also presents limitations. Enterprise-level censorship, hallucinations, and shallow philosophical depth can frustrate more advanced users. For instance, Microsoft has implemented filters that block terms related to politics, violence, or elections, posing challenges for critical engagement in higher education (Field, 2024). Ethically, Copilot’s cheerful tone can obscure its boundaries and limitations, becoming evasive when probed more deeply.</p>

<p>Beyond teaching, I have been involved in operational work to support wider digital access and learning. For example, I am leading the implementation of SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) and LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) to improve access to LinkedIn Learning through Moodle. While this is a technical undertaking, it directly supports UKPSF A2, A4, and K4. Moodle is already widely used by students and staff, so embedding LinkedIn Learning within it reduces access barriers and promotes uptake. SCIM will also allow for smoother logins and enable tutors to track student engagement with LinkedIn Learning alongside their own teaching materials.</p>

<p>Another key operational contribution is the development of the Digital Backpack a cross-institutional initiative that addresses a gap in digital skills assessment (Jisc, 2019). This project reflects my ability to manage complex TEL initiatives aligned with both pedagogical goals and institutional strategy. Through iterative consultation, I ensured the tool was both pedagogically robust and operationally feasible. The diagnostic is designed to provide students with timely, formative feedback, helping them identify areas for improvement. This aligns with UKPSF A4 and V3 by ensuring students are appropriately supported and encouraged to develop autonomy.</p>

<p>Confidence-building is central to my work. The Digital Backpack extends the confidence measures I use in my workshops. One of my observers noted, “Starting the session with an individual confidence-level test is a great way to encourage people to think about their prior knowledge.” The tool promotes further reflection and self-awareness, helping students take ownership of their development.</p>

<p>I have learned that it is difficult to completely eliminate subjectivity in assessment design. We all have biases, but by involving students and colleagues in the development process, I believe we can reduce their impact. The Digital Backpack is still evolving, and I am committed to gathering feedback and making continuous improvements to ensure it becomes more effective over time.</p>

<p>Finally, I continue to advocate for Markdown as a core TEL production tool. As one of the oldest and most robust text formats, Markdown offers structure, accessibility, and long-term viability. It is screen reader–friendly and supports keyboard navigation—benefits highlighted by Oelen and Auer (2019), who note that “it is possible to create presentation slides without the need for visual interaction, making it suitable for non-sighted users.” Unfortunately, Microsoft’s ecosystem is not optimised for Markdown. Tools like Word and Teams do not support clean Markdown workflows, limiting accessibility and reusability for content creators and users alike.</p>

## Reflective Area 3 – Wider Context

<p>Accessibility and data ethics are foundational to my professional identity. My MSc dissertation, *Can a Virtual Learning Environment Interface Meet the Needs of Dyslexics and Non-Dyslexics?* (Smith, 2001), explored inclusive interface design and advocated for flexible, learner-led approaches over rigid instructional models. Since then, I have contributed to sector-wide publications on accessibility (Smith, 2002) and remained actively engaged in CPD and peer collaboration to refine inclusive practices (UKPSF A5, V5).</p>

<p>My work consistently addresses systemic barriers to access, especially for students with learning differences or limited digital experience. Many Greenwich students experience digital inequality in terms of equipment, software access, or digital confidence. The Digital Backpack initiative offers a scaffolded and non-judgemental route to digital competence, embedding familiar platforms like Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn Learning. This helps address skill gaps without stigmatisation, ensuring inclusive engagement with institutional technologies (UKPSF V2, V5).</p>

<p>I also engage students in critical conversations about the ethical use of AI in education Scholars such as Selwyn (2019) and Luckin (2018) highlight the potential of AI for personalising learning but also warn about the risks of embedded bias, inequity, and opaque algorithmic systems. These concerns are especially pertinent as generative AI becomes more embedded in academic workflows. For instance, current institutional policy prohibits the use of AI-assisted translation for assessed work, while private tutoring—often expensive and unregulated—is permitted. I encourage students to critique these contradictions, fostering both digital literacy and ethical awareness (UKPSF K3, V5).</p>

<p>In my teaching, I present information management as stewardship: understanding what data is collected, who controls it, and how it may be used. This principle informs my advocacy for open standards and accessible content formats, which promote transparency, portability, and learner autonomy. It also underpins my technical choices such as my preference for Markdown over proprietary formats—as a way to maintain openness and resilience in digital content creation.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am increasingly concerned by the centralisation of digital learning environments under proprietary AI platforms. Unlike the early, decentralised internet, today’s generative AI tools—Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google Gemini are closed systems, reliant on vast, non-transparent infrastructures. This raises critical questions about academic freedom, institutional dependency, and the ethical governance of digital education.</p>

<blockquote><p>“There will be one company that creates a personal agent... Everything will be mediated through your agent... Whoever wins that will take the current dispersed, high profit areas, and move them into a single area.” </p>
<p>— Bill Gates (Gates, 2023)</p></blockquote>

<p>In this context, I believe educators must not only adopt digital tools but also interrogate their provenance, governance, and implications. This responsibility is central to my professional practice as a digitally literate and ethically grounded educator.</p>

## Reflective Area 4 – Specialist Interest
<details open>

/>

<p>My core area of specialist interest is the intersection of generative AI, immersive environments, and personalised learning. I am particularly drawn to open-source AI models that can run locally and be integrated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. These tools enable students to interrogate large sets of course data, reading lists, and materials using natural language—in their own voice and at their own pace. This reflects UKPSF A5, as I continue to enhance my professional practice by developing these emerging capabilities and exploring the boundaries of what educational technologies can offer.</p>

<p>I see enormous potential for building learning companions that are not just reactive but contextual. Imagine a student navigating an immersive Virtual Reality <a href="#glossary-vr" id="back-to-vr">(VR)</a> environment—engaging with course content visually, spatially, and interactively—while asking questions, testing ideas, and receiving tailored feedback from a localised, privacy-respecting AI tutor. While ambitious, this scenario aligns with the natural evolution of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and exemplifies UKPSF K1, by expanding the modes through which students can engage with their subject matter.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am beginning to explore how <a href="#glossary-microsoft-mesh" id="back-to-mesh">Microsoft Mesh</a> technology could be used to deliver context-appropriate immersive learning environments through Microsoft Teams. A key challenge lies in the use of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets and the various IT policies that come into play if such devices are institutionally supplied. While headsets are not strictly necessary as Mesh environments can also be accessed via standard 2D desktop screens, this may be perceived as a lesser experience by learners.</p>

<p>At present, widespread adoption of VR seems unlikely. Headsets remain expensive, bulky, and technically specialised. Even now, the university continues to provide on-site computer access for some students, reflecting a recognition of persistent digital inequality. It is difficult to imagine a near term scenario where VR headsets become ubiquitous enough for access to be assumed. However, Augmented Reality <a href="#glossary-ar" id="back-to-ar">(AR)</a> technologies are evolving more rapidly, with increasingly portable and cost-effective devices entering the market. As VR and AR continue to converge, the lower cost and improved portability of AR glasses may provide a more viable pathway for immersive learning. These developments offer a glimpse into how platforms like Microsoft Mesh could eventually be adopted more broadly in education particularly if delivered through devices that are more accessible, flexible, and well-suited to blended learning contexts. This aligns with UKPSF A4 (developing inclusive learning environments), K4 (evaluating learning technologies), and V2 (promoting equality of opportunity), while also reflecting a research informed mindset (V3).</p>

<p>At the same time, I remain concerned about the lack of open standards and the implications this has for academic freedom. Knox (2020) warns that AI’s integration into education can reflect national or corporate priorities, potentially undermining the autonomy of institutions and educators. While tools like Copilot offer significant functionality, their proprietary nature and opaque design limit their educational potential—particularly when we cannot interrogate or customise their outputs. This raises important ethical and practical considerations aligned with UKPSF V4 and K5.</p>

<p>In my own work, I advocate for transparent, student-focused AI systems that are built on ethical, open-source foundations. For example, I have begun experimenting with lightweight, local AI agents that can be deployed in closed environments for data-sensitive projects. I see these efforts as small but important steps toward reimagining AI not as a black box, but as a co-created, accountable partner in learning.</p>

<p>I believe in technology as a democratising force—but only if it remains open, ethical, and aligned with student empowerment, not corporate convenience. This vision underpins both my technical practice and my pedagogical stance.</p>

<p>My next formal step is applying for CMALT (Certified Membership of the Association for Learning Technology), which I see as an opportunity to consolidate and articulate the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) journey I am already on. I am fortunate to work alongside several Certified Members of ALT and look forward to joining that professional community. In line with UKPSF V3 and A5, I am committed to evidencing my learning approaches and continuously developing my professional practice. I believe CMALT recognition is a valuable step toward that goal.</p>

<p>In the longer term, I aim to explore collaborative research into the role of generative AI in education, building on initiatives such as the Digital Backpack—our institution’s digital capability assessment and credentialing tool. I also plan to improve my programming fluency, enabling me to prototype some of the tools and learning environments I currently envision. Currently, Generative AI itself is supporting that development, guiding me through Python and JavaScript as I experiment with new ideas.</p>

<p>Eventually, I hope to contribute more actively to the field through publications, collaborative tool-building, and knowledge exchange. I am also considering pursuing a PhD, though for now my focus remains on meaningful, practice-led development that empowers students and reimagines how assessment and learning can be approached in a rapidly changing educational landscape.</p>

<p>Before beginning this PGCert, I did not place great value on reflective practice. Now, having worked through a scaffolded portfolio process, I recognise reflection as essential—not only for academic development but also for refining my professional judgement and decision-making. I intend to continue this habit beyond the PGCert, using tools like Jekyll and Markdown to maintain a sustainable, portable professional portfolio.</p>

<p>This process has reinforced many of my core beliefs: that digital tools, when used thoughtfully, can democratise learning; that students thrive when given meaningful agency; and that educators and institutions have a responsibility to foster both empowerment and protection for learners. These principles reflect UKPSF V1 and V4.</p>

<p>It has also deepened my interest in systemic innovation—whether through immersive technologies, ethical AI, accessibility, or data minimalism—and has encouraged me to seek out evidence-informed approaches (UKPSF V3) in both strategy and pedagogy.</p>

<p>I conclude this phase of my professional development with a clearer sense of direction and a renewed belief that while technology often introduces new challenges, it also unlocks opportunities for creativity, inclusion, and transformation—particularly when guided by reflective and ethically grounded educators.</p>
