## 2a – Understanding of teaching, learning and/or assessment processes

### 2a Description

My teaching philosophy blends progressivism, constructivism, and humanism, aiming to build student agency through active, confidence-based learning. This informs the design of my digital skills workshops and the Digital Backpack, which assesses confidence as well as competence.

A key example is my generative AI workshop series, designed to introduce Microsoft Copilot in a non-technical, accessible way. These sessions focus on formative and self-directed uses of AI, such as summarising academic papers and generating analytical questions. Assessment is framed as confidence-building rather than gatekeeping, with learners encouraged to critically evaluate AI outputs.

### 2a Reflection

Student feedback has significantly challenged and reshaped my approach to workshop design. While online teaching offers many advantages for demonstrating digital technologies—particularly due to the medium's inherent flexibility and immediacy—it also presents unique challenges. One of the most persistent issues is the reluctance of students to turn on their cameras, often due to social appearance anxiety (SAA). This phenomenon, defined as the fear of negative evaluation based on one’s appearance (Levinson et al., 2013), has been shown to reduce engagement and memory retention in synchronous online learning environments (Tien et al., 2023).

As a tutor, the absence of visual feedback makes it difficult to gauge student engagement and adapt in real time. To address this, I have adopted tools such as Mentimeter for anonymous polling, the chat feature in Microsoft Teams, and shared live documents and whiteboards. These tools have enabled me to foster greater participation and implement rolling formative assessment, aligning with Sadler’s (1989) theory that formative feedback enhances learning by helping students close the gap between current and desired performance.

This shift also reflects a move towards more inclusive and student-centred pedagogy. By reducing the pressure of visual self-presentation and offering multiple modes of interaction, I aim to create a psychologically safer learning environment. The use of anonymous feedback tools supports students who may otherwise disengage due to appearance-related concerns, which are increasingly recognised as barriers to participation in online education (Tien et al., 2023; Levinson et al., 2013).

In future iterations, I plan to further explore how appearance-related anxiety intersects with digital confidence and how adaptive workshop design can mitigate these effects. This will include evaluating the impact of self-view settings, peer interaction formats, and the role of asynchronous components in reducing cognitive load and anxiety.

My approach aligns closely with Bandura’s (1997) concept of self-efficacy: I have seen repeatedly that students’ digital skills develop fastest when they believe they are capable of success. For example, when introducing Copilot, I scaffold activities so that students build from simple “warm-up” tasks to more complex academic uses. This reflects Vygotsky’s theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978), where carefully designed prompts enable learners to move beyond their current ability. These theoretical frames underpin my practice, giving me a language to explain why confidence and progression are central to my design.

## 2b – Understanding of your target learners

### 2b Description

The University of Greenwich has a diverse student population, including many from widening participation backgrounds, international students with varying English language proficiency, and mature learners returning to study. My work directly addresses these varied needs through accessible workshop design, SCORM-based diagnostics compatible with multiple devices, and AI workshops framed in plain language without technical jargon.

Student co-design is embedded in my practice. For example, Backpack prototype testing included sessions with students who provided feedback on interface clarity, question framing, and inclusivity.

### 2b Reflection

Understanding learner diversity has shifted my approach from “designing for the average user” to intentionally designing for the margins — ensuring that those with the greatest barriers still have equitable access.

In one workshop, a student became tearful after I demonstrated how to use generative AI to research technical questions and receive answers tailored to their level of understanding. She had previously been too frightened to ask questions for fear of ridicule, but now felt empowered to explore and learn independently. This moment reinforced for me that digital confidence is not only a skills issue but also an emotional one, and highlighted the importance of creating safe, supportive environments for learners.

Adopting this principle benefits all users, but it also requires more extensive upfront testing and iteration to ensure that no learner is left behind.
