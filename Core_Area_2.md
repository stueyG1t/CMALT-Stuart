## 2a – Understanding of teaching, learning and/or assessment processes

### 2a Description

My teaching philosophy blends progressivism, constructivism, and humanism, aiming to build student agency through active, confidence-based learning. This informs the design of my digital skills workshops and the Digital Backpack, which assesses confidence as well as competence.

A key example is my generative AI workshop series, designed to introduce Microsoft Copilot in a non-technical, accessible way. These sessions focus on formative and self-directed uses of AI, such as summarising academic papers and generating analytical questions. Assessment is framed as confidence-building rather than gatekeeping, with learners encouraged to critically evaluate AI outputs.

### 2a Reflection

Through this work I have learned that confidence can be as critical as competence in determining whether students engage with digital tools. Incorporating AI as a “companion” rather than a replacement for student thinking has helped address fears and misconceptions, particularly for those with low prior exposure to digital tools.

If redesigning, I would incorporate more peer-to-peer demonstration within sessions, allowing learners to share strategies and normalise experimentation.

## 2b – Understanding of your target learners

### 2b Description

The University of Greenwich has a diverse student population, including many from widening participation backgrounds, international students with varying English language proficiency, and mature learners returning to study. My work directly addresses these varied needs through accessible workshop design, SCORM-based diagnostics compatible with multiple devices, and AI workshops framed in plain language without technical jargon.

Student co-design is embedded in my practice. For example, Backpack prototype testing included sessions with students who provided feedback on interface clarity, question framing, and inclusivity.

### 2b Reflection

Understanding learner diversity has shifted my approach from “designing for the average user” to intentionally designing for the margins — ensuring that those with the greatest barriers still have equitable access. This approach benefits all users, but requires more extensive upfront testing and iteration.
