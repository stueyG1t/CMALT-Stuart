## Specialist Area: Institutional development / strategic work

### Description

My specialist expertise lies in developing and delivering institution-wide digital capability initiatives that combine technical integration, pedagogic design, and strategic alignment. The Digital Backpack is a flagship example: a Moodle-based diagnostic and progression tool that maps confidence and competence across digital skills, aligned with sector frameworks, and embedded in curriculum delivery.

Alongside this, I have led the SCIM and LTI integration of LinkedIn Learning, ensuring data-driven engagement and value realisation from the institutional subscription. Both projects required cross-team leadership, system design, user testing, and long-term sustainability planning.

### Reflection

Working at this strategic level has reinforced that technology projects succeed when they address institutional priorities and student needs simultaneously. The Backpack’s success has come from positioning it not just as a tool, but as part of the university’s wider “digital-first” vision.

If I were to repeat the process, I would build in formal evaluation from the start — particularly for measuring long-term impact on student digital confidence and employability outcomes.
