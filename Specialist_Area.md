## Specialist Area: Institutional development / strategic work

### Description

My specialist expertise lies in developing and delivering institution-wide digital capability initiatives that combine technical integration, pedagogic design, and strategic alignment. The Digital Backpack is a flagship example: a Moodle-based diagnostic and progression tool that maps confidence and competence across digital skills, aligned with sector frameworks, and embedded in curriculum delivery.

Alongside this, I have led the SCIM and LTI integration of LinkedIn Learning, ensuring data-driven engagement and value realisation from the institutional subscription. Both projects required cross-team leadership, system design, user testing, and long-term sustainability planning.

### Reflection

What makes the Digital Backpack a specialist area is its scale and strategic integration. Many practitioners create digital diagnostics or embed external tools, but my work differs in three ways:

1. **Cross-institutional alignment** — linking diagnostics with university policy and curriculum design.
2. **Sector influence** — sharing the Backpack concept at conferences and shaping external practice.
3. **Innovative pedagogy** — embedding confidence-based, software-agnostic skills assessment rather than tool-specific training.

These elements elevate the work beyond normal practice into a distinctive specialist contribution.

Working at this strategic level has reinforced that technology projects succeed when they address institutional priorities and student needs simultaneously. The Backpack’s success has come from positioning it not just as a tool, but as part of the university’s wider “digital-first” vision.

If I were to repeat the process, I would build in formal evaluation from the start — particularly for measuring long-term impact on student digital confidence and employability outcomes.

>“Shout out to Stuart Smith and Jingyang Ai for their sterling work on creating the Digital Backpack — a digital skills portfolio and self-assessment tool to help students identify digital skills they will need for their learning and future roles. This project has been a true collaboration across teams and engenders the ethos of ILS. Really well done to the project leads and all who have supported it.” — Head of Department, University of Greenwich
